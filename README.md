# qt_add_qml_module() example multiple modules

qt_add_qml_module() is an awesome CMake function introduced in Qt 6.2 that streamlines various aspects of organizing QML modules.
However, we had a feeling that there are not many examples and demos out there that were showing more than just a very basic case.

Therefore we created a demo application that facilates this CMake blessing. Currently implemented cases:
- Main module with files in subfolders
- Three extra modules inspiring for better QML files structuring
- Adding singleton QML types to the QML module
- Adding JavaScript files to the QML module
- Adding resources to the QML module
- Adding dependencies to the QML module
- Marking specific files in the module as private
- Adding C++ registered QML type to QML module
